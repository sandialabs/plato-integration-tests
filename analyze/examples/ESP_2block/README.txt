Runs the problem to convergence which should reach the global minimum. This test can be seen as a verification test. It was necessary to change some of our default parameters in rol_input.xml and eliminate one of the design parameters to get this test to work. The default ROL parameters were changed with a sed command appended to XMLGEN_COMMAND in the CMakeLists.txt for this test. It would be good to revisit this test using defaults and all 5 design parameters after we've established a better baseline.
